    <h2 id="about">What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      The Summer of Nix is a two month train & work project that will take place
      between <emph>August 2nd to October 15th 2021</emph>. It is made for anyone
      who wants to rapidly increase their Nix skills while doing useful work for
      the Nix and the wider FOSS community - all of this together in a remote
      team and getting paid a nice stipend. After the program, there will be
      opportunities for continued work as paid freelance contractor with the
      NixOS foundation.

    <h2>Who is organizing this, and why?</h2>
    <p>
      The program is funded via the European Commission's Next Generation Internet
      Initiative and organized by members of the core Nix development team, the
      <img style="display: inline;height:1rem;width:auto;transform:translateY(0.2rem);" src="images/logo.png"></img>
      <a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS foundation</a>,

      <img style="display: inline;height:1rem;width:auto;transform:translateY(0.2rem);" src="images/tweag.png"></img>
      <a href="https://tweag.io">Tweag</a>. The wider goal is to <emph>establish
        Nix as one of the principal platforms for free and open source software</emph>.
      Concretely, this means packaging many free and open programs, and improving
      the general packaging situation in Nix. The program is set up to train up
      to 30 participants to become at ease in the Nix ecosystem and to deliver as
      many packages as possible from a list of strategic projects.

    <h2>For whom is this interesting?</h2>
    <p>
      This program is <emph>great for students, professionals or
        passionates</emph> who can spend the time over summer to rapidly increase
      their Nix skills while doing useful, paid work. What we need from you
      is commitment, motivation for two months of full time work and basic Nix
      knowledge. You should know what a nix shell is, the basics of nixpkgs and
      the language, as explained in the
      <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills">nix pills</a> tutorials, for
      example. Of course, also a reasonably fast computer and internet connection
      is required although we might be able to provide some cloud infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
      <emph>Experienced Nix packagers are also welcome to participate in a
        mentoring role</emph> that involves reviewing, helping out with questions,
      direct individual mentoring, and also hands-on packaging. Mentoring is a
      flexible part time role, approximately equivalent to 1 day of work per
      week. If you are interesting in spreading Nix knowledge and also enjoy
      light-weight team organization, this role is for you!

    <h2>Time Zones</h2>
    <p>
      The program is open to applicants from <emph>all time zones and countries</emph>.
      Although many members of the organization committee are based in Europe,
      training sessions and workshops will be adjusted as good as possible to
      work for the majority of participants and flexible arrangements will be
      found for others.

    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>
      The compensation for participants is fixed to a <emph>base stipend of 2750
        Euro</emph> in all member states of the European Union and associated
      countries like Norway, the UK and Switzerland. Elsewhere, this base is
      adjusted with a factor taking into account purchasing power parity similar
      to the GSoC program. The precise stipend amounts will be communicated
      individually to succesful applicants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mentors will be paid aligned to standard contracts with the NixOS
      foundation and details will be communicated individually.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <emph>Is a GitHub account required?</emph> -
        Yes
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>What are the application deadlines?</emph> -
        There are no fixed deadlines but we plan to select and confirm
        participants twice, on May 15th and on July 1st so that they have a
        definite confirmation. However, we have so much interest for this
        program that we encourage you to apply as early as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I am interested to participate but want to take vacation can I still join?</emph> -
        Yes, you are expected to work 8 of the 11 weeks that this program runs.
        Please write us your availability in the application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I am a student. Can I use this program as internship?</emph> -
        There is no universal answer to this since internship programs differ
        from country to country and even university to university. We are open to
        internships but please contact us so that we can figure out together
        whether it is possible or not.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I'm not a student. Can I also apply?</emph> -
        Yes. We welcome any motivated individuals who want to learn
        state-of-the-art Nix, and have the time and ability to participate. Do
        make sure that you can take the 2 months full time learning and working
        with Nix. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I don't know anything about Nix. Can I apply?</emph> -
        We expect at least basic experience with Nix, which would hopefully allow
        us to move you up to an advanced level during the course of the summer
        program. So if Nix is all new to you and you find this kind of
        program interesting - deep dive into learning Nix straightaway, and make
        sure you are ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I cannot program, do I need to?</emph> -
        Yes, fundamental programming skills are definitely required but profound
        knowledge is not. The software we are packaging could be written in
        various programming languages and so, during the program, you might need
        to figure out how to deal superficially with those language ecosystems
        that it uses and also sometimes with those of the dependencies. Luckily,
        there are tens of thousands of packages already in nixpkgs to learn from.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Which packages are we going to package?</emph> -
        We will package a number of cutting edge free and open source
        applications in the field of
        <a href="https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroPET.html">privacy and trust</a>
        enhancing technologies, as well as tools aimed at <a href="https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroDiscovery.html">search,
          discovery and
          discoverability</a>. These range from tools to develop open hardware chips to
        fediverse applications, but all of them have one thing in common: they
        are actively developed libre community projects, funded through the
        <a href="https://nlnet.nl/NGI0">NGI0 Zero</a> program.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Who is going to mentor?</emph> -
        Established community members will be available for questions and
        mentoring for less experienced participants and structure the program
        besides the organizers of this program.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I could mentor. Are you looking for more mentors?</emph> -
        Yes, please write us an email.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>What is expected to be delivered at the end of the Summer of Code?</emph> -
        We aim to deliver, all together, about three Nix packages per participant
        (including mentors). This is our global output as a team! There is no
        fixed required amount of packages per participants. Some important high
        value packages are a lot more difficult to package than others and this
        will be taken into account. The goal is to achieve this goal together as
        a team and maybe even more. What counts as well for us is participants
        with improved Nix knowledge and improvements to the general Nix packaging
        situation in the form of tutorials or other documentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I find this program really interesting but can't participate because of the way it is structured. What
          should I do?</emph> -
        Please reach out to <a href="mailto:summer@nixos.org">summer@nixos.org</a> and write us what is holding
        you back. This is the first time this program runs and feedback
        is important to us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I can't commit full time time. Can I still participate?</emph> -
        In principle any help to achieve the overall goal of the project is
        welcome. If you feel that this is nevertheless the case, please
        reach out to <a href="mailto:summer@nixos.org">summer@nixos.org</a>
        and describe your situation. You will be placed in a list of people
        willing to participate under special conditions and we will think about
        how to integrate you in the program. Expect more details about how this
        could look like shortly after May 15th.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Where can I get more information?</emph> -
        Please send us a mail to <a href="mailto:summer@nixos.org">summer@nixos.org</a>.
