    <h2 id="update-2022-04-04">Summer of Nix 2022 Announcement!</h2>
        <p>Summer of Nix 2022 will happen <strong>from 15th of July to 30th of September</strong>!</p>
        <p>Following the excitement of Summer of Nix 2021 (more in <a href="https://summer.nixos.org/assets/report-2021.pdf">last year’s report</a>), I am happy to announce that the European Commission, NLNet and the NixOS Foundation have granted enough budget to organize another community event this year. After some brainstorming sessions I am excited to share how we (an organization committee of ~8 people now) would like to organize this event.</p>
        <p>Summer of Nix is <strong>a paid summer program</strong> where you can <strong>learn, meet, and work</strong> with the Nix community. It targets experienced Nixers and Nix newcomers alike to come together and work on a range of different topics. At the same time, there will be talks about Nix and presentations by Nix-using companies with the goal of fostering a strong sense of community and pushing the ecosystem forward together.</p>
        <p>What’s new this year is that we offer …</p>
        <ul>
        <li>a <strong>communication stream</strong> to write quality documentation, deployment stories, tutorials, and produce video content and podcast episodes;</li>
        <li>an <strong>ecosystem stream</strong> to work directly on Nix tooling that improves the overall packaging and package user experience;</li>
        <li>a <strong>packaging stream</strong> to package new free and open source software either within nixpkgs or as independent flakes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All streams focus on improving Nix support for the <strong>free and open source (FOSS) ecosystem</strong> from different angles, as last year with emphasis on the packages sponsored by the European Commission via the NGI initiative and NLNet.</p>
        <p>You can participate in Summer of Nix in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>As a participant</strong> you will work full time on various projects together with other participants within the 3 work streams for about 8 weeks (with some flexibility, e.g. to take vacation). This is the main role in Summer of Nix and great for those who work in a team to share and improve their Nix skills, meet nice people while contributing to the community.</li>
        <li><strong>As a team coordinator</strong> you will lead a small team, arrange communication and mentoring, and guide technical discussions and decisions. You will also be involved in the overall organization of the program with other coordinators. Technical work in this role includes reviewing PRs and answering technical questions. Hours can vary, but on average the time commitment is about 12 hours a week. Experienced Nix tinkerers with a social knack are encouraged to apply for this role. If you’re interested in Nix and also enjoy team organization, this role is for you!</li>
        <li><strong>As a tech wiz</strong> you will pair program with participants, answer their questions, review their PRs, and show them how to get along with Nix. This is a great way to be involved if you are an experienced Nixer and enjoy helping others in a flexible way.</li>
        <li><strong>As a project lead</strong> you offer a project within the three work streams. You would work together with participants on this project, and provide them with guidance and technical expertise. This is great for anyone who is looking for support on their own Nix project. If you have an idea, please apply, but understand that projects have to fall within the three work streams and we will need to evaluate whether they can fit within the scope of the European Commission’s grant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The compensation depends a bit on each role but will roughly be oriented on Google’s Summer of Code stipend for the participant roles.</p>
        <p><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/HyAQLTXDtHy0JNGvRIwWXa6Swmxb31LuWsOoPRcmD-8/">Applications are open here from now until May 15th</a>.</p>
        <p>Please write to summer@nixos.org if you have questions. In addition to this, we will also have <strong>a separate sponsor track</strong> for companies who want to connect with the community in this program this year. But more about this later…</p>

    <h2 id="about">What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      The Summer of Nix is a two month train & work project that will take place
      between <emph>August 2nd to October 15th 2021</emph>. It is made for anyone
      who wants to rapidly increase their Nix skills while doing useful work for
      the Nix and the wider FOSS community - all of this together in a remote
      team and getting paid a nice stipend. After the program, there will be
      opportunities for continued work as paid freelance contractor with the
      NixOS foundation.

    <h2>Who is organizing this, and why?</h2>
    <p>
      The program is funded via the European Commission's Next Generation Internet
      Initiative and organized by members of the core Nix development team, the
      <img style="display: inline;height:1rem;width:auto;transform:translateY(0.2rem);" src="images/logo.png"></img>
      <a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS foundation</a>,

      <img style="display: inline;height:1rem;width:auto;transform:translateY(0.2rem);" src="images/tweag.png"></img>
      <a href="https://tweag.io">Tweag</a>. The wider goal is to <emph>establish
        Nix as one of the principal platforms for free and open source software</emph>.
      Concretely, this means packaging many free and open programs, and improving
      the general packaging situation in Nix. The program is set up to train up
      to 30 participants to become at ease in the Nix ecosystem and to deliver as
      many packages as possible from a list of strategic projects.

    <h2>For whom is this interesting?</h2>
    <p>
      This program is <emph>great for students, professionals or
        passionates</emph> who can spend the time over summer to rapidly increase
      their Nix skills while doing useful, paid work. What we need from you
      is commitment, motivation for two months of full time work and basic Nix
      knowledge. You should know what a nix shell is, the basics of nixpkgs and
      the language, as explained in the
      <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills">nix pills</a> tutorials, for
      example. Of course, also a reasonably fast computer and internet connection
      is required although we might be able to provide some cloud infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
      <emph>Experienced Nix packagers are also welcome to participate in a
        mentoring role</emph> that involves reviewing, helping out with questions,
      direct individual mentoring, and also hands-on packaging. Mentoring is a
      flexible part time role, approximately equivalent to 1 day of work per
      week. If you are interesting in spreading Nix knowledge and also enjoy
      light-weight team organization, this role is for you!

    <h2>Time Zones</h2>
    <p>
      The program is open to applicants from <emph>all time zones and countries</emph>.
      Although many members of the organization committee are based in Europe,
      training sessions and workshops will be adjusted as good as possible to
      work for the majority of participants and flexible arrangements will be
      found for others.

    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>
      The compensation for participants is fixed to a <emph>base stipend of 2750
        Euro</emph> in all member states of the European Union and associated
      countries like Norway, the UK and Switzerland. Elsewhere, this base is
      adjusted with a factor taking into account purchasing power parity similar
      to the GSoC program. The precise stipend amounts will be communicated
      individually to succesful applicants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mentors will be paid aligned to standard contracts with the NixOS
      foundation and details will be communicated individually.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <emph>Is a GitHub account required?</emph> -
        Yes
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>What are the application deadlines?</emph> -
        There are no fixed deadlines but we plan to select and confirm
        participants twice, on May 15th and on July 1st so that they have a
        definite confirmation. However, we have so much interest for this
        program that we encourage you to apply as early as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I am interested to participate but want to take vacation can I still join?</emph> -
        Yes, you are expected to work 8 of the 11 weeks that this program runs.
        Please write us your availability in the application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I am a student. Can I use this program as internship?</emph> -
        There is no universal answer to this since internship programs differ
        from country to country and even university to university. We are open to
        internships but please contact us so that we can figure out together
        whether it is possible or not.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I'm not a student. Can I also apply?</emph> -
        Yes. We welcome any motivated individuals who want to learn
        state-of-the-art Nix, and have the time and ability to participate. Do
        make sure that you can take the 2 months full time learning and working
        with Nix. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I don't know anything about Nix. Can I apply?</emph> -
        We expect at least basic experience with Nix, which would hopefully allow
        us to move you up to an advanced level during the course of the summer
        program. So if Nix is all new to you and you find this kind of
        program interesting - deep dive into learning Nix straightaway, and make
        sure you are ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I cannot program, do I need to?</emph> -
        Yes, fundamental programming skills are definitely required but profound
        knowledge is not. The software we are packaging could be written in
        various programming languages and so, during the program, you might need
        to figure out how to deal superficially with those language ecosystems
        that it uses and also sometimes with those of the dependencies. Luckily,
        there are tens of thousands of packages already in nixpkgs to learn from.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Which packages are we going to package?</emph> -
        We will package a number of cutting edge free and open source
        applications in the field of
        <a href="https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroPET.html">privacy and trust</a>
        enhancing technologies, as well as tools aimed at <a href="https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroDiscovery.html">search,
          discovery and
          discoverability</a>. These range from tools to develop open hardware chips to
        fediverse applications, but all of them have one thing in common: they
        are actively developed libre community projects, funded through the
        <a href="https://nlnet.nl/NGI0">NGI0 Zero</a> program.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Who is going to mentor?</emph> -
        Established community members will be available for questions and
        mentoring for less experienced participants and structure the program
        besides the organizers of this program.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I could mentor. Are you looking for more mentors?</emph> -
        Yes, please write us an email.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>What is expected to be delivered at the end of the Summer of Code?</emph> -
        We aim to deliver, all together, about three Nix packages per participant
        (including mentors). This is our global output as a team! There is no
        fixed required amount of packages per participants. Some important high
        value packages are a lot more difficult to package than others and this
        will be taken into account. The goal is to achieve this goal together as
        a team and maybe even more. What counts as well for us is participants
        with improved Nix knowledge and improvements to the general Nix packaging
        situation in the form of tutorials or other documentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I find this program really interesting but can't participate because of the way it is structured. What
          should I do?</emph> -
        Please reach out to <a href="mailto:summer@nixos.org">summer@nixos.org</a> and write us what is holding
        you back. This is the first time this program runs and feedback
        is important to us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>I can't commit full time time. Can I still participate?</emph> -
        In principle any help to achieve the overall goal of the project is
        welcome. If you feel that this is nevertheless the case, please
        reach out to <a href="mailto:summer@nixos.org">summer@nixos.org</a>
        and describe your situation. You will be placed in a list of people
        willing to participate under special conditions and we will think about
        how to integrate you in the program. Expect more details about how this
        could look like shortly after May 15th.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Where can I get more information?</emph> -
        Please send us a mail to <a href="mailto:summer@nixos.org">summer@nixos.org</a>.
