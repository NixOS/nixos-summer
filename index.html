    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
    The Summer of Nix is a two month train &amp& work project that will take
    place between August 2nd to October 15th 2021. It is made for anyone who
    wants to rapidly increase their Nix skills while doing useful work for the
    Nix and the wider FOSS community - all of this together in a remote team
    and getting paid a nice stipend. After the program, there will be
    opportunities for continued work as paid freelance contractor with the
    NixOS foundation.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Who is organizing this, and why?</h2>
    <p>
    The program is funded via the European Comission's Next Generation Internet
    Initiative and organized by members of the core Nix development team, the
    <img style="display: inline;height:0.8rem;width:auto;" src="images/logo.png"></img>
    NixOS foundation,
    <img style="display: inline;height:0.8rem;width:auto;" src="images/nlnet.png"></img>
    the NLnet foundation and Tweag. The wider goal is to establish
    Nix as one of the principal platforms for free and open source software.
    Concretely, this means packaging many free and open programs, and improving
    the general packaging situation in Nix. The program's is set up to train up
    to 30 participants to become at ease in the Nix ecosystem and to deliver as
    many packages as possible from a list of strategic projects.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>For whom is this interesting?</h2>
    <p>
    This program is great for students, professionals or passionates who can
    spend the time over summer  to rapidly increase their Nix skills while
    doing useful, paid work. What we need from you is commitment,
    motivation for two months of full time work and basic Nix knowledge. You
    should know what a nix shell is, the basics of nixpkgs and the language as
    explained, for example, in the nix pills tutorial. Of course, also a
    reasonably fast computer and internet connection is required although we
    might be able to provide some cloud infrastructure.

    Experienced Nix packagers are also welcome to participate in a mentoring
    role that involves reviewing, helping out with questions, direct individual
    mentoring, and also hands-on packaging. Mentoring is a flexible part time
    role, approximately equivalent to 1 day of work per week. If you are
    interesting in spreading Nix knowledge and also enjoy light-weight team
    organization, this role is for you!
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Time Zones</h2>
    <p>
    The program is open to applicants from all time zones and countries.
    Although many members of the organization committee are based in Europe,
    training sessions and workshops will be adjusted as good as possible to
    work for the majority of participants and flexible arrangements will be
    found for others.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>
    The compensation for participants is fixed to a base rate of 2750 Euro in
    all member states of the European Union and associated countries like
    Norway, the UK and Switzerland. Elsewhere, this base rate is adjusted with
    a factor taking into account purchasing power parity similar to the GSoC
    program. The precise stipend amounts will be communicated individually to
    succesful applicants.

    Mentors will be paid aligned to standard contracts with the NixOS
    foundation and details will be communicated individually.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <emph>Is a GitHub account required?</emph> -
      Yes
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I am interested to participate but want to take vacation can I still join?</emph> -
      Yes, you are expected to work 8 of the 10 weeks that this program runs.
      Please write us your availability in the application.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I am a student. Can I use this program as internship?</emph> -
      There is no universal answer to this since internship programs differ
      from country to country and even university to university. We are open to
      internships but please contact us so that we can figure out together
      whether it is possible or not.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I'm not a student. Can I also apply?</emph> -
      Yes. We welcome any motivated individuals who want to learn
      state-of-the-art Nix, and have the time and ability to participate. Do
      make sure that you can take the 2 months full time learning and working
      with Nix. 
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I don't know anything about Nix. Can I apply?</emph> -
      We expect at least basic experience with Nix, which would hopefully allow
      us to move you up to an advanced level during the course of the summer
      program. So if Nix is all new to you and you find this kind of
      program interesting - deep dive into learning Nix straightaway, and make
      sure you are ready.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I cannot program, do I need to?</emph> -
      Yes, fundamental programming skills are definitely required but profound
      knowledge is not.​​​​​​ The software we are
      packaging could be written in various programming languages and so,
      during the program, you might need to figure out how to deal
      superficially with those language ecosystems that it uses and also
      sometimes with those of the dependencies. Luckily, there are tens of
      thousands of packages already in nixpkgs to learn from.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>Which packages are we going to package?</emph> -
      We will package a number of cutting edge free and open source
      applications in the field of privacy and trust enhancing technologies, as
      well as tools aimed at search, discovery and discoverability. These range
      from tools to develop open hardware chips to fediverse applications, but
      all of them have one thing in common: they are actively developed libre
      community projects, funded through the NGI Zero programme.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>Who is going to mentor?</emph> -
      Established community members will be available for questions and
      mentoring for less experienced participants and structure the program
      besides the organizers of this program.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I could mentor. Are you looking for more mentors?</emph> -
      Yes, please write us an email.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>What is expected to be delivered at the end of the Summer of Code?</emph> -
      We aim to deliver, all together, about three Nix packages per participant
      (including mentors). This is our global output as a team! There is no
      fixed required amount of packages per participants. Some important high
      value packages are a lot more difficult to package than others and this
      will be taken into account. The goal is to achieve this goal together as
      a team and maybe even more. What counts as well for us is participants
      with improved Nix knowledge and improvements to the general Nix packaging
      situation in the form of tutorials or other documentation.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I find this program really interesting but can't participate because of the way it is structured. What should I do?</emph> -
      Please reach out to <a href="mailto:summer@nixos.org">summer@nixos.org</a> and write us what is holding
      you back. This is the first time this program runs and feedback
      is important to us.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>Where can I get more information?</emph> -
      Please send us a mail to <a href="mailto:summer@nixos.org">summer@nixos.org</a>.
