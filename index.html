      <h1>The gist of it</h1>
      <p>
      The Summer of Nix is a two month train and work project that will take
      place from August 2nd to September 30th 2021. It is made for anyone who
      wants to rapidly increase their Nix skills while doing useful work for the
      Nix and the wider FOSS community - all of this in a remote team, at your
      favourite place and getting paid a nice stipend. After the program, there
      will be opportunities to continue longer term as paid freelance contractor
      with ad-hoc Nix packaging tasks.

      <h1>Who is organizing this, and why?</h1>
      <p>
      The program is funded via the European Comission's Next Generation
      Internet Initiative, and organized by members of the core Nix development
      team, the NixOS foundation, the NLnet foundation and Tweag. The wider
      goal is to establish Nix as one of the principal platforms for free and
      open source software. Concretely, this means packaging about 250 free and
      open programs that are supported by the NLNet foundation, and improving
      the general packaging situation in Nix. This program's approach is to
      train a team about 20 participants to become at ease in the Nix ecosystem
      and to deliver packaged, ready-to-use software together.

      <h1>For whom is this interesting?</h1>
      <p>
      Students, professionals or passionates who want to rapidly increase their
      Nix skills while doing useful, paid work are all welcome. Experienced Nix
      packagers are also very welcome to participate in a mentoring role. What
      we need is time commitment, motivation and basic knowledge of Nix (see
      below).
